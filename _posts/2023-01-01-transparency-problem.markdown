title: The transparency problem in computational research
description: |
  <p class="lead">
  Particularly problematic are studies that employ sensitive or proprietary data
  for which access and reuse are restricted; streaming, transient, or ephemeral
  data that cannot be used to verify reproducibility due to their dynamic nature;
  or very large-scale or specialized computational resources available only to
  authorized users. In these cases, verification by repeating computations may not
  be possible.
