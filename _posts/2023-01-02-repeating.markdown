title: The problem with repeating computational results
description: |
  <p class="lead">
  Research communities across the sciences are requiring that authors share the
  data, code, and methods used to obtain computational results. However, without
  verification by repeating computations, there is no guarantee that provided
  artifacts are complete or can actually be used to produce reported results.
