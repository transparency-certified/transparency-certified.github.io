title: Trusting computational research without repeating it

  <p class="lead">
  How can we trust the integrity of results from research that relies on
  computations without repeating them? By certifying the successful <u>original</u>

  With certifications in hand, consumers of research can trust the transparency
  of results without necessarily repeating computations.
